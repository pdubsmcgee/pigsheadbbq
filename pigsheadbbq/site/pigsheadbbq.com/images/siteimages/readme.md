# Site Images (not tracked as binaries)

This folder is intentionally kept without committed binary image files.

To display production photos, upload JPG/PNG files to this exact folder in your deployed site (or via your hosting media pipeline), then reference them as:

- `images/siteimages/foodtruck.jpg`
- `images/siteimages/brisket.jpg`
- `images/siteimages/pulledpork.jpg`
- `images/siteimages/ribs.jpg`
- `images/siteimages/cheeseymac.jpg`
- `images/siteimages/desserts.jpg`
- `images/siteimages/trophy.jpg`
- `images/siteimages/originalsmoker.jpg`

The templates/pages are already wired to these paths.

# Customer Upload Staging Folder

Drop new photos in this folder so they can be reviewed and added to the website.

- Recommended formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`
- Use descriptive names, e.g. `brisket-platter-july-2026.jpg`
- Keep files reasonably sized for web use

This folder is only a repository drop zone; files here are not automatically shown on the site until referenced in templates/pages.

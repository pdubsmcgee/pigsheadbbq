  <h1>A Little Something About Pigs Head BBQ</h1>
  <p>
    James Sluss has worked in the restaurant industry for nearly two decades. He graduated from culinary school at
    GRCC in Grand Rapids, Michigan, served on the U.S. Culinary Team, and built experience in kitchens across the state.
  </p>
  <p>
    His love for barbecue started early as the family grill master, then grew while working under a chef who made some
    of the best pulled pork he had ever tasted. Since then, BBQ has become a true obsession—testing regional styles,
    refining rubs, and perfecting house-made seasonings and sauces.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2012, James began developing his own craft BBQ on a smoker he built from a 1950s Philco refrigerator. Over time,
    he upgraded equipment, sharpened his process, and served friends, family, and restaurant guests. What began as
    catering for small groups turned into roadside service in Gobles in 2017, thanks to encouragement from his wife,
    Michelle.

    At Pigs Head BBQ, we stand out with Michigan craft barbecue—from Texas-style 17-hour smoked brisket to dry-rubbed
    St. Louis-style ribs and legendary smoky beans loaded with 16-hour pulled pork. We serve sauce on the side so the
    smoke, bark, and seasoning stay front and center.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sauce still matters, though. We hand-make six varieties in small batches, including our take on Alabama white,
    sweet-and-spicy Carolina vinegar, and a golden honey favorite. Each one is made to complement the meat, not cover
    it up.

  <p>
    From that first fridge smoker to where we are today, our mission has stayed the same: serve the best BBQ we can,
    every single time.
